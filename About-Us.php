                                        forethought and careful analysis of the entire system, its threats, weaknesses
                                        and
                                        strengths, we formulate ideas and strategies to reduce risk and strengthen the
                                        system. We consider the problem from all angles too, not just from the outside
                                        in,
                                        but also from the inside out. Those ideas will then be used to devise a plan of
                                        action that will ensure all security threats, and their solutions, are well
                                        understood so we can begin to prepare phase two.

                                    <p>Phase two involves the design solution. Our technical team advise on how a
                                        security measure can be carried out with a several of different angles in mind.
                                        The solution is documented in two phases. A high level ‘design summary’ is drawn
                                        up so everyone understands exactly what the design will accomplish and how it
                                        will accomplish the task at hand. Then we draw up the ‘detailed design’ which
                                        will provide the technical specifications to be used in the next phase, the
                                        implementation.
